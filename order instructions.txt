# This is a blind adjudicator. It can function without even seeing the map or board state
# (assuming all the submitted orders are legal). For blind adjudication to work, I needed to 
# make some slight improvements to the order syntax.
#
# 1) There is no such thing as an implict hold order. If you don't give a unit a hold order, 
# the adjudicator won't know it's there. It's blind! 
#
# 2) There is no such thing as an implicit convoy order. All convoys must use the 'via' keyword.
# However the via keyword works differently from in the usual rules. The word after via points
# to the ship which is providing the convoy. The full syntax for a convoy move is:
#
# A [territory] MOV [destination] via [sea territory]
# F [sea territory] CON [territory] to [destination]
#
# In the case of a chain of convoys, the via territory refers to the first ship in the chain.
# All subsequent ships in the chain (except the last one) must also use the via keyword. 
# The full syntax for a convoy chain is:
#
# A [territory] MOV [destination] via [sea territory 1]
# F [sea territory 1] CON [territory] to [destination] via [sea territory 2]
# F [sea territory 2] CON [territory] to [destination]
#
# In the case that there is more than one convoy route, the 'or' keyword may be used after the 
# via territory. The full syntax for a multi route convoy is:
#
# A [territory] MOV [destination] via [sea territory 1] or [sea territory 2] or ...
# F [sea territory 1] CON [territory] to [destination]
# F [sea territory 2] CON [territory] to [destination]
# ...
#
# Fleets that are part of a chain may also use multi-routing with the 'via [x] or [y] or ...' 
# syntax. The only restriction is don't make a circular convoy route. 
#
# 
# Other notes: Parsing is unforgiving right now.
# Make sure to write orders in the expected format (CAPITALIZATION AND SPACING MATTER).
# Only one space between each keyword / territory name. 
# The order keywords are "HOL", "MOV", "SUP", and "CON". Grammar keywords like 'via' and 'or' 
# are lowercase. Unit type keywords are "A" and "F". 
# Territory names can be any string of letters without spaces so long as spelling
# and capitalization are consistent. Call it "EnG_ChAnNeL" for all I care. 
# Multi-coast territories are not yet implemented. 
# The exact syntax for each type of order is:
#
# hold:                      [A/F] [territory] HOL
# move:                      [A/F] [territory] MOV [destination]
# convoyed move:             A [territory] MOV [destination] via [sea territory]
# multi-route convoyed move: A [territory] MOV [destination] via [sea territory 1] or [sea territory 2] or [sea territory 2] or...
# support hold:              [A/F] [territory] SUP [helped territory] HOL
# support move:              [A/F] [territory] SUP [helped territory] MOV [destination]
# convoy:                    F [territory] CON [helped territory]
# convoy chain:              F [territory] CON [helped territory] MOV [destination] via [sea territory]
# multi-route convoy chain:  F [territory] CON [helped territory] MOV [destination] via [sea territory 1] or [sea territory 2] or...
#
# By convention I use "A", "B", "C"... as placeholder names for territories
